# Bang
The Bang! dice game

//We came up with what we needed to do next: 
//
//Brainstorm: 
//Week 1: 
// decision making combined with player decision
// computer choose to use abilty when its there based on affiliation
// add variables that change every turn, (for every player run through it), such as attacking, attacked, died, 
// arrowsAttacking (global), gattlingAttack(global), 
// havent added dynamite, but since its automatic, shouldnt be too
// get images for background and learn to make nice scene
// Making a better gui
//
// we need to be able to add an extra dice, (so methods needs to run through the entire lenght of the player's hand, instead of just 5 times, when we add a dice to this array)
// 
// we might need to record how much is healed
// coward dice (double beer health, and remove 1 arrow)
// loud mouth (double shot damages)
// black dice: (one and two become replaced with "duel")
//
// how to make this more object oriented?



//character we'll include from the expansions:
//
//Old Saloon: Doc Holiday(8) 
//Jose Delgado (7), 
//TEQUILA JOE (7)

//The computer always picks to use a duel card? and they each roll and if one of them doesnt get a duel in their hand, they lose a life, if they do roll, the other guy has to roll
//the person they choose is the person they normally attack
//GREG DIGGER (7) - You may use each wiskey you roll twice (always heal self unless deputy, in which case heal Sheriff)
//SEAN MALLORY (8) - (CPU always uses it,) You may reroll a Duel die once on your turn

//SAM THE HEALER (7) - Whenever you draw a duel,  
 
// Display Text on the GUI
// Button that cycles each turn and carries out the game 
   //Making these cycles occur

//Use Abilty Button, it only works if its a usable ability, and the current player is human,
//making the number of players appear different based on how many are alive

//when the players die - change the array size
